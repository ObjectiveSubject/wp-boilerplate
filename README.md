The Objective Subject Boilerplate. Adapted from the "_s" theme: http://underscores.me

Getting Started
---------------

If you want to change the theme's namespace, you'll need to do a five-step find and replace on the name in all the templates.

1. Search for `'obsub'` (inside single quotations) to capture the text domain.
2. Search for `obsub_` to capture all the function names.
3. Search for `Text Domain: obsub` in style.css.
4. Search for <code>&nbsp;obsub</code> (with a space before it) to capture DocBlocks.
5. Search for `obsub-` to capture prefixed handles.

Then, update the stylesheet header in `style.css` and the links in `footer.php` with your own information. Next, update or delete this readme.
